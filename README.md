My name is Oscar Nierstrasz.
I am Professor emeritus of Computer Science at the [University of Bern](http://www.unibe.ch/index_eng.html), where I founded the [Software Composition Group](https://scg.unibe.ch/) in 1994.
I retired from the University at the end of 2021, and am currently working at [feenk.com](https://feenk.com/about/) to support onboarding and teaching of moldable development. 
I am co-author of over 400 [publications](https://www.oscar.nierstrasz.org/publications), including the open-source books Object-[Oriented Reengineering Patterns](https://www.oscar.nierstrasz.org/oorp/) and [Pharo by Example](http://books.pharo.org/).
